Ultra-realistic macro photography of a giant, freshly prepared sushi roll, with tiny, highly detailed Japanese chefs in traditional white uniforms and headbands meticulously assembling it. Some chefs stand on bamboo scaffolding, carefully slicing and arranging vibrant, fresh salmon, while others spread glossy soy sauce with delicate brushes. One chef is rolling the sushi with an oversized bamboo mat, while another sprinkles sesame seeds from a miniature wooden bowl. The deep black seaweed contrasts with the bright white rice, avocado, and crisp cucumber. Dramatic cinematic lighting enhances textures and colors, with steam rising slightly to emphasize freshness. Photorealistic, 8K resolution, volumetric lighting, shallow depth of field. --ar 9:16 --quality 2 --profile g2snl5m --stylize 450
