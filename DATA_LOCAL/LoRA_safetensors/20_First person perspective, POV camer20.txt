First person perspective, POV camera shot, ultra-realistic, high-quality, cinematic, 4K â€“ Seated atop a powerful Mongol warhorse, its head partially visible in the frame, my gloved hand extends forward, pointing toward a burning village below. Mongol warriors on horseback charge through wooden gates, torches in hand, as flames engulf thatched rooftops. Arrows streak through the smoke-filled sky, the clash of steel and distant war cries echoing across the open steppe. --ar 9:16
