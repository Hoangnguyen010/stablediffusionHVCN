A black panther, a jaguar, and a tiger peeking through dense jungle foliage, surrounded by lush tropical leaves. Stylized, hand-painted illustration with soft, organic textures and visible brushstrokes. The animals have expressive eyes and a slightly whimsical, folk-art-inspired aesthetic. Rich, deep greens dominate the scene, with warm golden and orange tones adding contrast. The composition is balanced, with the animals partially hidden among the leaves, creating a mysterious yet inviting atmosphere. Inspired by modern botanical illustrations and hand-painted wildlife art --ar 2:3
