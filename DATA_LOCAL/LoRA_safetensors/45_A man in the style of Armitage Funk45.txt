A man in the style of Armitage Funk strolls along an alleyway, his shadow stretching long on the wooden floorboards. He wears a hat and coat, holding a bag over his shoulder. Sunlight shines through the building windows, creating light rays that illuminate the street. The scene is reminiscent of film noir, with a sense of mystery and intrigue. --ar 2:3
