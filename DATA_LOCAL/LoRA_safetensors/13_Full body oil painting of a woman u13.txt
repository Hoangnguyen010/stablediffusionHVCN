Full body oil painting of a woman underwater in a pool, capturing intricate details on her skin and hair underwater, with vivid colours reflecting off the surface. Air bubbles coming out of her nose. The painting uses focus stacking to bring out fine textures, depicting a summer day with an overhead view, dynamic lighting, and a sunlit, vibrant scene. --ar 11:16 --sref 1446355679 1417608223 --profile uyze1sf --stylize 50 --weird 2
